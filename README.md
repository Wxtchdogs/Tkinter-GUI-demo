# Password generator V2
The second version of my password generator makes use of a grid instead of .pack in Tkinter.

### Current features:
Same features as V1 +
* Save passwords to file (file is auto created)
* Copy to clipboard
* Password history
* Fancier (Password is re-generated each time the length slider moves)
### Password generator V2.1
* Empty passwords aren't saved
* Duplicate passwords aren't saved
* General bug fixes and clean up of code
### If copy to clipboard does not work then follow these steps:
1. Firstly ensure that "PIP" is installed on your machine. Open command prompt and type "pip"
```
pip
```
If it is not then refer to https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/pip-command-not-found

2. Install pyperclip. Open command prompt and type:
```
pip install pyperclip
```
