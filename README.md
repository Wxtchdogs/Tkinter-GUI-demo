# Weather app V1

This script requires the installation of the PyOWM library as well as a PyOWM API key.

1. Firstly ensure that "PIP" is installed on your machine. Open command prompt and type "pip"
```
pip
```
If it is not then refer to https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/pip-command-not-found

2. Instal PyOWM. Open command prompt and type:
```
pip install pyowm
```

3. Make an open weather map account and generate an API key. https://openweathermap.org/api

4. Go to line 37 of the script and replace 'ENTER_PYOWM_API_KEY_HERE' with your API key.
